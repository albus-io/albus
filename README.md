# Albus: The Next Generation of VPN

## About the Project

Albus is an open-source platform that transcends existing VPN technologies, initiating a new era in cybersecurity. Built on a foundation of post-quantum ready cryptography, AI-driven autonomous security, and a Zero Trust architecture, our mission is to secure the future of digital privacy and anonymity with a verifiability-based transparency model.

### Key Features and Architecture

  * **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Our protocol integrates algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, standardized by NIST, to provide absolute protection against future quantum computer attacks. This establishes a security layer beyond the conventional encryption methods used by current VPNs.
  * **Autonomous Security and Threat Response:** Beyond being a passive tunnel service, Albus incorporates an AI-powered Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS). It analyzes network traffic for anomalies and patterns in real time, automatically isolating and responding to threats without human intervention.
  * **Zero Trust Architecture:** No component within the network is trusted by default. All participants must cryptographically prove their identity using zero-knowledge proofs. Access privileges are dynamically managed according to the principle of least privilege.
  * **Verifiable Transparency:** The entire Albus codebase is open-source, and the system is designed to be deterministic. This allows third parties to mathematically verify our "no-logs" policy and security claims.

## Project Status

The Albus project is currently in an intensive development phase. Work is underway on core protocol specifications, architectural designs, and the prototyping of key components. By watching this repository, you can stay informed about the project's progress.

## Contributing

Albus is firmly committed to the philosophy of open source. We would be delighted to welcome all developers, security researchers, and technology enthusiasts who wish to support this revolutionary vision. While it is still early for code contributions, you are welcome to share your ideas and suggestions with us through the [Discussions](https://github.com/albus-io/albus-project/discussions) section.
